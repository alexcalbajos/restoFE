L’Utilisateur devra sélectionner le Restaurant et les plats de la carte ou du menu qu’il désire. Seules les commandes qui dépassent un certain montant affiché sur le site web pourront être réalisées. A la date de publication des présentes Conditions Générales d’Utilisation ce montant est de 15 euros.\n\nPour pouvoir continuer avec la commande, l’utilisateur doit s’enregistrer en remplissant le formulaire d’enregistrement ou bien, s’il s’agit d’un utilisateur enregistré, il devra s’identifier. Finalement, l’utilisateur devra introduire l’adresse de livraison, choisir le jour et l’heure de la livraison et sélectionner le mode de paiement.\n\nPour finir la commande l’utilisateur devra relire et accepter les Conditions Générales d’Utilisation puis cocher la case «J’accepte les conditions générales d’utilisation» et enfin cliquez sur «Valider la commande».\n\nAprès la validation de la commande, l’Utilisateur est dirigée vers la page de paiement et choisi le type de paiement. Une fois le paiement effectué, l’utilisateur ne peut plus modifier la commande et le choix de livraison. Il appartient à l’Utilisateur, préalablement au paiement et sous sa seule responsabilité de s’assurer de l’absence d’erreur. RESTO-IN ne peut en aucun cas être tenu responsable des erreurs de l’Utilisateur.\n\nDès lors que le paiement est effectué, la commande de l'Utilisateur auprès de RESTO-IN est définitive. RESTO-IN traite la demande de l’utilisateur concerné et envoye, conformément à la réglementation applicable, un e-mail de confirmation de commande en indiquant que celle-ci est en cours.\n\nS’agissant d’une commande de produits de restauration, il est porté à l’attention de l’utilisateur que ce dernier ne bénéficie d’aucun droit de rétractation à la suite du paiement de sa commande et de la réception du mail de confirmation de commande faisant démarrer l’exécution de la commande ce que l’utilisateur reconnait et accepte expressément.\n\nRESTO-IN n’est pas tenu de fournir les produits commandés dans le cas où le paiement fait par l’utilisateur n’est pas autorisé pour une raison quelconque.\n\nUne fois que l’utilisateur a confirmé la commande et le paiement a été autorisé, il ne peut pas annuler sa commande, ni demander son remboursement.\n\nSi vous désirez changer ou annuler une commande qui a été déjà faite et dont le paiement a été autorisé, vous pouvez contacter notre Service Clientèle et celui-ci fera ses meilleurs efforts en fonction du degré d’exécution de la commande afin d’effectuer, le cas échéant, les modifications qui peuvent raisonnablement être réalisées de ladite commande. Cependant, RESTO-IN ne peut pas garantir que les demandes de modifications ou annulations faites par l’utilisateur puissent prospérer.\n\nL‘Utilisateur est informé que RESTO-IN acquière les produits alimentaires de la commande auprès du Restaurant sélectionné par l’Utilisateur. lLe Service Clientèle de RESTO-IN est chargé de prendre en compte les réclamations des clients concernant les retards, oublis de plats, ou autres désagréments survenus au cours des livraisons de commandes. Le cas échéant et après examen de l´incident dûment justifié par l’Utilisateur, RESTO-IN pourra procéder au remboursement partiel ou total de la commande, ou offrir une compensation d´un autre type à l’Utilisateur.\n\nLes temps de livraison ou d’enlèvement sont fournis par RESTO-IN en considération des informations qui lui sont fournies par les Restaurants et ils sont par conséquent indicatifs et susceptibles de varier en fonction des aléas journaliers. RESTO-IN ne peut pas garantir que les commandes soient délivrées ou disponibles pour leur enlèvement dans les temps estimés. Concernant la livraison, celle-ci est opérée dans la tranche horaire indiquée par l’Utilisateur. Cette tranche horaire est susceptible de varier dans une amplitude maximale d’une heure. Il en va de même des temps d’enlèvement. Dans tous les cas, le service délivré à la Clientèle est extrêmement important pour RESTO-IN. Dans ce cadre, dans le cas où vous n’êtes pas satisfait avec la qualité du service et/ou des plats demandés via le Site Web, RESTO-IN examinera, dans la mesure du possible, toute demande dûment justifiée de remboursement total ou partiel de la commande.\n\nL’Utilisateur a par ailleurs la possibilité, dans un délai de 48 heures à partir de la livraison ou de l’enlèvement de sa commande, d’émettre un avis, directement sur le Site Web, sur la prestation rendue et faire bénéficier ainsi auprès d’autres utilisateurs de leur expérience. RESTO-IN se réserve la possibilité de modérer les contenus ainsi mis en ligne si ces derniers sont manifestement tronqués, malveillants ou contraire à sa politique éditoriale.\n\n7. PRIX ET MODE DE PAIEMENT\n\nLes prix sont indiqués sur le Site Web. Sur le résumé des commandes apparaissent les prix avec la TVA incluse. Sur les prix indiqués dans le résumé de la commande sont exclus les coûts de livraison, lesquels seront ajoutés au montant total à payer une fois que l’adresse de livraison de la commande est fournie.\n\nDans le cas où, en raison d’une erreur, le prix correct d’une commande est plus élevé que le prix publié sur le Site Web, RESTO-IN contactera l’utilisateur qui a acheté le menu avec le mauvais prix avant de traiter la commande, pour l’informer du bon prix et obtenir sa confirmation de la commande. En aucun cas RESTO-IN n’est obligé à délivrer la commande pour un prix inférieur au prix correct ni à opérer un avoir auprès des utilisateurs à cause de l’erreur sur le prix indiqué sur le Site Web.\n\nLe paiement peut se faire par carte de crédit ou carte de débit. Les paiements en argent ou «Ticket Restaurant» sont aussi disponibles dans les villes de Bruxelles, Berlin, Hambourg, Barcelone et Madrid et doivent être effectués pour le montant exact.\n\nLorsque vous effectuez un paiement avec carte de crédit ou carte de débit, vous pouvez être invité, au moment de la livraison, à montrer la carte avec laquelle vous avez fait le paiement comme témoin d’identification et pour que le Restaurant puisse vérifier que les données de la carte coïncident avec celles du reçu de la commande. Le paiement sera effectué à travers le serveur bancaire de nos partenaires commerciaux (HSBC). Par conséquent, le paiement par carte bancaire offre une sécurité absolue; votre commande sera enregistrée et validée au moment où la banque accepte le paiement. Toutefois, notez que des retards peuvent survenir dans le traitement des paiements et des transactions, ce qui peut entraîner des retards allant jusqu’à soixante (60) jours dans le débit sur votre compte bancaire ou sur le débit de votre carte de crédit ou carte de débit.\n\nPendant la procédure d’achat, les utilisateurs peuvent utiliser le cas échéant les codes promotionnels acceptés par RESTO-IN pour appliquer une réduction sur le prix total de la commande.\n\nLes utilisateurs ont la possibilité d’enregistrer les données bancaires de leurs cartes de crédit ou cartes de débit pour éviter de les introduire à nouveau lors de leurs futurs achats.

    "ABOUT_3_DESC": "No restaurant, no meal, no deliverer, no delivery ! At Resto-in, we do believe that all actors involved in the delivery of your meals have the same importance. Each stakeholders must be able to live decently. That’s why we made the choice to hire part of our deliverer and to work with delivery companies that hire their deliverer. You might already have heard in the past month about the insecure status of “independent” deliverers. If most of the food delivery platforms decided to work with these deliverers, for cost reason, we believe at Resto-in that we must consider the deliverer working conditions. These “independant” deliverer are paid for each delivery, they usually have a very low social welfare, have no paid leave, no health insurance and get no unemployment benefit if they stop their activity. At Resto-in, we made the opposite choice. The high majority of our deliverer are employed, which offers them the same advantages as any classic worker  : health insurance, unemployment benefits, paid leave, … It’s definitely more expensive, but in our opinion, safety, protection, and decent working condition are priceless right ! When all of our deliverer are busy, your delivery request is automatically sent to Stuart company. We selected this partner because it takes care about its deliverer, offering healthcare services.",
